Launcher -  Using an ultrasonic sensor (or some kind of detection device) to detect when the ball rolls past the sensor to then 
launch it back into the playing field automatically. Some sort of signal from the playing field turning off the automatic launcher 
when something happens or when the game is over. (servo motor with hammer to launch them up?) In order to control the servo motor I would need to 
edit the steps per revolution and the speed at which it moves. This will take a lot of testing. I will also experiment with ways the ball falls into
some kind of holder where it can easily be hit to run back into the playing field. I might have this be on its own arduino or we may put it on an 
arduino with the paddles.
